       <p>In terms of work view, I believe work is more than just working a full-time job, part-time job, or internship.
         Work view is about strengthening your skillset level, learning new techniques about technology or the field you are studying. During my time of “working” I go to my part-time IT support job, if not that studying for classes, and if I am finished with classes I code. I code websites, keep up to date with new waves and forms of technology. I also think a work view is to find other and better opportunities
         for oneself if one does not feel as fulfilled in the position they are in right now. For example, when I do have free time, I use that free time to apply for job positions and to update my resume when learning new forms of technology. Another form of work view is making sure your schedule is organized, working hard and so much can lead to disorganization if one forgets about things in their life.
         I also look at my journal every day and notepad to make sure I am up to date on classes, job applications, resumes, and current job performance. From comes good work, good work is just the result of this
         type of work view I believe. </p>
       <br>
	<p>Life is much more worthwhile when you are actually living it, and not looking at it from afar, watching other people enjoy their own lives. In essence,
    living life is the medium that everyone should try to attain. Doing things that make you happy
    and strive for greatness. I love to do yoga, read books, commune with my family, and travel all over the city.
    That is what makes me happy and makes me want to get out of bed and live life again each and every day.
    The things that I do when living definitely resonates and comes from my family morals/ background. Eating and staying healthy is a concept that I was brought on as a young child,
    taking care of your body so that you can live on the years well and happy. I don’t think fame has anything to do with living life, at all.
    That is not on my list for living, not fame, I hate that word. It may sound very cliché, but I think being and staying happy is the goal to living life.
    That is my goal anyway.</p>
    <br>
	<p>Overall, in my reflections of work view and life view, I see how maintaining and trying to reach greatness with career can be seen equivalent
    to achieving happiness in life. Both have a goal to reach, one is happiness, and one is greatness.
    Those two words have different meanings, however, are one in the same.
