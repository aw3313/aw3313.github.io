Black Feminism </h2>



		<p> Black Women‚Äôs Manifesto, published by the Third World Women‚Äôs Alliance, is a confident, blunt, and fiery proposal that should be appraised for. The talk of exploitation of black women and the future for black women are both important topics that the women‚Äôs alliance took very seriously and carefully. The talk about birth contraception is a topic most people don‚Äôt want to talk about, however is still prevalent in present day America. The women‚Äôs alliance also talks about the white feminists, and how there is an obvious difference to what black women are fighting and what white women want in America.

‚ÄúIf the white groups do not realize that they are in fact, fighting capitalism and racism, we do not have common bonds. If they do not realize that the reasons for their condition li e in a debilitating economic and social system, and not simply that men get a vicarious pleasure out of ‚Äòconsuming their bodies for exploitative reasons,‚Äô (This kind of reasoning seems to be quite prevalent in certain white women's groups) then we cannot unite with them around common grievances or even discuss these groups in a serious manner, because they're completely irrelevant to black women in particular or to the black struggle in general.‚Äù(pg 31)

White women do not fight for black women, it is still obvious in today‚Äôs society. They do not fight for us.
