		<h2> May 1st, 2019	Radical </h2>



<p>
  Often times people assume the word radical as an equivalence to crazy, way out there in reference to the extreme. In an etymological sense, through a social or political change, the views or ideas are entirely different from the root up. Radical tends to fight against the status quo and advocates for a progressive section to social or political reform. The importance of imagination becomes a vital part of the word radical. To some extent, a radical framework focuses on the root of the problem, the turning of the table if you will.

  Consequently, the reason the word radical even comes into being is because of the internalized contradictions that interplay with the social structure of the government or regime. Huey P. Newton, a revolutionary African American and co-founder of the black panther party, declared in an interview with William F. Buckley Jr. that his main fundamental theory of truth is that contradiction is the ruling principle of the universe. No matter what type of political or social structure enforced into a society, there will always be an internalized contradiction compelled by that order. This is where the nativity of the status quo and the word radical comes into play. Not just the paranoia of the mind, but a real social danger can bring upon the radical ideology in a society. Take the American revolution for example, on July 4th, 1776 America had gained her independence from Great Britain and for what reason? To some extent a built up of ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù and other daunting events that led to the insurrection.
