		<h2> May 7th , 2019	History Workshop: Apartheid South Africa The White Psyche; South Africa</h2>


	  <p>
Hendrik Verwoerd‚Äôs ideas were the basis for a form of white supremacy in South Africa apartheid, that unfolded as a reign of terror for blacks.  His writings, like his speech delivered to white masses of South African republic on May 31, 1996, suggested a pervasive white anxiety that animated their racism.  This poses a question of the white psyche; what exactly is this undisclosed white guilt and fear that appears to only intensify as the white psyche during apartheid unfolded, even after Verwoerd's assassination in 1966? Though white liberals understood themselves to be different than the conservatives, black consciousness leaders like Steve Biko thought they shared an underlying racist psyche. The evident anger and hatred shown in South Africa from whites toward the ideology behind black consciousness shows a sense of hate for one‚Äôs own race, the human race. Why, or how did this form of the white psyche thrive in South Africa? How, if at all, did it change over the course of the apartheid period?

		To investigate the question of the white psyche during the time of the Apartheid in South Africa, one must dive into the beginnings of South Africa‚Äôs white colonizers invading a land they thought was theirs to take. The whole idea of white colonization is to justify the fact that blacks cannot rule themselves. Verwoerd believed in this thought process and even said, ‚ÄúThe masses would become to great extent unemployed and the land desolated, as we have seen elsewhere in Africa‚Äù (Verwoerd). White settlers in any situation, ‚Äúwho agitated and fought for freedom from what they regarded as alien or external rule, were not inclined to extend the kind of liberty they demanded for themselves to the nonwhites over whom they ruled as slave-owners or conquerors... the cause of white freedom and independence was directly linked with a desire to maintain flagrant forms of racial hegemony.‚Äù  (Fredrickson 113). This quote gives question to a White South African‚Äôs belief in what ownership means to them. Do whites believe that privilege is somehow endowed only on to them? That by some ‚ÄúManifest Destiny‚Äù they should be true rulers of the blacks in South Africa? In Marzia Milazzo‚Äôs  ‚ÄúOn White Ignorance, White Shame, and Other Pitfalls in Critical Philosophy of Race‚Äù, Milazzo quotes philosophers and historians on the rhetoric of racial power in the white world, ‚ÄúSullivan repeatedly conceives white people as being ‚Äòconstituted by‚Äô something unconscious or preconscious (habits), something outside of their control (affects), or something external to them, as in ‚Äòthe (white-privileged) world.‚Äô
