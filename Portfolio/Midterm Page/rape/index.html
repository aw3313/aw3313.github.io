Gloria‚Äôs Steinem Expose on Playboy;
A Journalist Protest </h2>



		<p> In 1963, Gloria Steinem went undercover as a Playboy Bunny Housemate, in order to live a genuine experience in Hugh Hefner‚Äôs Playboy Club. Throughout her experience, Steinem discovers the outlandish and disgusting rhetoric, sexist and lines of prostitution, racist bigotry, and actions that were a huge objectification of women. The protest itself was the combination of going undercover as a playboy bunny and exposing Playboy with her two-part article called, ‚ÄúA Bunny‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù With this article, I will explore the context and background of woman during this time period of the 1960‚Äôs. What was changing and going on in women‚Äôs lives that played a part in the purpose of this protest? I will also dive into the intersectionality in the exploitation of women and pornography. How did sexuality and pornography become such a popular and worldwide interest during the 1960‚Äôs that played a part in playboy? 1950‚Äôs was seen as a time of the housewife and the wants to hide sexuality, nakedness, and porn in America. Why did there become an influx of things like the Playboy Bunny Club? I will ask questions and look into how pornography played a role in the objectification and exploitation of women, and how patriarchal structures used pornography as a another tool to control women.
