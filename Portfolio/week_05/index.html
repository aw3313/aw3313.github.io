      <p>  Who created artificial intelligence? Humans did and as human beings we have our own prejudice and racists bias opinion on other ethnicities, genders, and race. How should we all be surprised about the outcome of this prejudice from AI, when as human beings, we are doing these horrible things to our own kind.</p>

      <p>My previous website on Self- Portrait was based on ImageNet and I was happy to have that experience. ImageNet just reaffirms there is still a lot of prejudice and racists opinion and beliefs in this world. Even if these bias opinions are originating from the subconscious, we as a people ideally should make a difference in AI when it come to this prejudice. AI only reflects the creator and to some extent this is where the confusion between AI and human beings becomes a problem. If AI is taught not to be prejudice to different ethnicities, but sees human beings doing those things, who is more evil? The robot or humans? </p>
