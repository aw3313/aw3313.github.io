		<h3> What is Web? Web Squared!
		</h3>

		<div class="transition">

				<h1> From reading the article Web Squared,  The question I want to know and hope to know is whether the rapid growth on the ‚Äúinternet‚Äù and just the mass expansion for the web, will turn out to be just like the events that followed during the ‚Äúdotcom bust‚Äù?! Could the massive expansion of Web 2.0 be in the same type of disarray in relation to dotcom bust? What makes Web 2.0 different? Throughout the article the importance of ‚ÄúCollective Intelligence‚Äù is noted as a necessity to the Brave New World of the internet. Data is the new age of what generates the expansion of the world wide web. With that being said, artificial intelligence is definitely a gate way into the exponential growth of the Web.
In continuation about collective intelligence, the article goes into detail about search engines and the topic is brought up on whether due to the Web growing, is the Web itself getting smarter? I found this question to be really fascinating and made me think about Google, which I believe to be one of the many good examples of what collective intelligence is. Of course, the article goes on to talk about Google and their expertise on learning systems when it comes to search engines and the internet. In the article, there is a statement on what goes on in the learning process and what is also interesting is the teaching of explicitly and implicitly meaning on something. I believe that we as a society are teaching AI the unstructured way of data.
