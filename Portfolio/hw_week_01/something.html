		<h3>John Berger Review</h3>
		<h2>	By Ashia White!!</h2>
    <p>John Berger goes into specific detail about European artistry and
			the European “renaissance” by itself. Berger argues about the human eye,
			only being physically capable or seeing objects by one perspective.
			The human eye can only keep up with one object, such as art. With this being said,
			Berger believes because of the originality with the human eye’s capabilities,
			humans could only understand one perspective of the painting.
			 However, as humans have progressed overtime and have created new inventions,
			 the perspective of the painting has changed. </p>

		<p> Let’s take the camera as an example of John Berger’s message to the audience from this film.
			The progression from just the naked eye of the human being to a complex camera, the perspective,
			 he claims, has changed dramatically. The camera gives the viewer of these European paintings a
			 different angle of perspective, since it is physically able to focus on not only just one piece,
			 but multiple pieces of art. With this in mind, once someone gets to notice different angles and
			  pieces of art, there becomes a creation of a different perspective.
				Berger argues that this is the reason why people in the 20th century and
				eventually the 21st century have an entirely different perspective then
				when a piece of art was created before any type of innovation, other that the human eye. </p>
