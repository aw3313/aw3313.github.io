    <h3> User Testing Notes</h3>

    <p> For the user testing on my website, I was told to use flex box instead of a grid, due to flex being more "flexible" or easier to use. I was unable to use
    flex box due to actually having difficulties with my flex boxes. I asked many people on how I could put the NTF company
  into my website and alot of people said to put my logo on first web page to distinguish what people are going to look at. I also got help with my google fonts
and google font effects which was helpful to my website and brand name. I was corrected on my color choices for fonts and people approved of the matrix sort
of vibe I was going for. I was also encouraged to embrace the 1983 vibe and go with this very techno like flavor on my website. I was told to center my words on the second
web page and on the tv screens, (looks more aesthetically pleasing). I also got help on postion and absolute and since I was having some trouble with flex, I
used postion/ablsolute for the words on the second web page </p>

<p> Below is a picture of my NTF logo and I was told to incorporate that specific logo onto my website. I tried to incorporate my logo onto the website, but unfortunately
  for some reason I just didnt see it fitting into my website and also the image is a jpg so I would have to go edit it to make have a see through background.
  In the future I will definetly put this logo on my website. In the future, I would also like to add more content of my "tv" portions on the second web page. I don't
  think I reached my full goal on that level in connection with my midterm proposal. So I am looking into that in the future for sure <p>
