  <h2> <li> <a href=" https://www.hbo.com/watchmen/watchmen-listen-to-official-podcast">The Official Watchmen Podcast, Masks 1-3 Episode</a> </li> <h2>
    <p> I have been studying simulations lately with game design and such so when Lindelof talked about trying to make this comic book real and authentic as possible,
      this stood out to me for sure. His objective in his show is about “RACE”. I believe he makes it as obvious as possible, that is something that resonated with me since my creations
      are always about social issues. I should make it a priority to be very obvious with where my audience is at. I do feel as though Lindelof is teaching his own people about the “Race Problem” in America.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>3 inputs for Lindelof in creating watchmen</p>
      <p>
<p>  1.	Wanted to make it real and authentic as possible </p>

  <p>2.	He was able to educate himself when working with watchmen about “Reparations” and “Black Wall-Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma”</p>

<p>  3.	He discovered stuff through interpretations from other people, not only from the books itself.</p>

<br>
<p>at least 3 inputs for your senior project</p>

<p>1.	When naming my creation, a great way would be to list of adjectives. (To describe the original Watchmen that’s how they created the name)</p>
<p>2.	Be obvious with what your creation is directed to, for example “RACE”</p>
<p>3.	My project will definitely be about education others who may not know or need to see the sickness and heal the cultural anxiety in America.</p>

      <p>Truly and Honestly this portion of the reading about the epicenter really made me feel better about starting my project. I always tend to overwhelm myself with a bunch of ideas and just go for it. Instead taking a step back and analyzing what exactly is the “Epicenter” of my project. I think this is where my research will start. I know I want to have an interface between wearable and app/website. Should I start with website or wearable? This is something I will be looking into for sure. I do agree that building a frame before building the content is a great way to start any type of project and will make an effort in using Pinterest to start design and framework with creative cloud. This reading emphasizes the importance of taking everything step by step. </p>
<br>
<h1> Week 2: Weekly Update 02/08/2021 </h1>

<p> Created a Pinterest Board for my project, once i have created some inspo for that, will be posting
  a sketch next week of how my design will look, then looking over iterations, and then using creative
  cloud Adobe XD to create a the digital design.</p>

      <p>The first thing that comes to mind when reading this chapter is the that don't resist your own creativity,
      don't be a hinderance to your own ideas. Pretty much what this chapter is saying to me is to "Just Do It" essentially.
    The first draft is the most authentic and real version of what you are creating. Don't worry if it's not perfect, doesn't make
  sense at first, just go with it. This is close to my heart, because I tend to be so judegemental with myself in terms of my creations.
And its a bit easier to create a project when you have very specific guidelines. The difference between this class is that there are no specific guidelines,
eveything is freeform. I create my own guidlines and that is scary for a college student. Filling in the gaps once the first draft is created makes
more sense and brings me somewhat of a relief. I need to keep in mind not to be too hard on myself and to just build on from my first draft. From this reading I do
believe it is better to start with action and then reflect on what you actually created, then you from the evalution you can created on top of what has already been built, or
take away. Keep working and dont give up speaks volumes to me, I do whatever i takes to finish all my projects, I don't like to have a partly finish creation.</p>
<br>
<h1> Week 3: Weekly Update 02/18/2021 </h1>

<p> Hope you checked out my pinterest board! Now I know I said that I would start sketching my design, but ever since I
read "Epicenter Design", I have taken a step back. The pinterest board has helped with what main tools I would like to use
for my project, but now I need to put it somewhat into the physical. I have planned a meeting with Kathleen McDermott, for creating a wearable
with the intersection of a website using p5.js. She was my teacher last semester for my creations in wearables and I think her guidance
will help tremedously in focusing on the epicenter of my design.</p>

<p> I have scheduled a meeting with Kathleen McDermott on Wednesday Feburary 24th at 1:00pm for my gadget wearable

<p> In all honesty, this reading to me was a bit too much for my liking. I can understand how resistance and one’s “Peripheral Opponents” are dangerous to a creative mindset.
  These two obstacles can definitely be warranted as dark loom shadow over the creative mind. However, the idea of seeing them as “dragons” and saying it’s a life-or-death experience is a bit much.
   I personally don’t take life to seriously and I don’t think anyone should be so serious on themselves, it isn’t the healthiest thing to do from my own experiences.
    The metaphors used in this specific reading about slaying a dragon to me is a bit much. What was interesting to me was the use of the word love, loving the project you are creating.
    Having that passion and drive to for a specific creation and/or project is familiar to me. Now one will not always have that passion for the project, but I guess you can have an overall passion for that creation.
